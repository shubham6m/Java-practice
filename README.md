# Java Practice

This repository contains my Java practice work, organized into different folders based on topics, concepts, or problem types.  
It serves as a personal learning space to improve Java programming skills and explore various problem-solving techniques.

---

## 📂 Structure

The repository is divided into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific area of Java:

- **Exception handling/** – Programs demonstrating try-catch-finally, throw/throws, and custom exceptions.
- **Generics/** – Examples of generic classes, methods, and type parameters in Java.
- **Greedy/** – Greedy algorithm-based problem solutions.
- **Heaps (Priority Queue)/** – Implementations of Min Heap, Max Heap, and priority queue problems.
- **Java DSA Problems/** – Mixed data structure and algorithm practice problems.
- **Linked List/** – Singly, doubly, and circular linked list operations and problems.
- **Patten Print Problem/** – Java programs to print patterns using loops (stars, numbers, etc.).
- **Stack/** – Stack operations and related problem-solving.
- **String/** – String manipulation, searching, and algorithm-based problems.
- **Vectors/** – Programs using Java Vector class for dynamic arrays.
- **array/** – Array-based problems like searching, sorting, and manipulation.
- **binary tree/** – Binary tree creation, traversal, and problem-solving.
- **constructor/** – Examples of default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- **dp/** – Dynamic Programming problems and solutions.
- **graphs/** – Graph representations and algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest paths).
- **hashing/** – HashMap, HashSet, and hashing-based problems.
- **multithreading/** – Thread creation, synchronization, and concurrency examples.
- **oops/** – Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
- **queue/** – Queue, deque, and priority queue implementations.
- **segment tree/** – Segment tree implementation for range queries.
- **sliding window/** – Sliding window technique for subarray and substring problems.
- **sorting/** – Sorting algorithms like bubble, merge, quick, and insertion sort.

*(Folder names may change or expand as the repository grows.)*

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen understanding of Java syntax and concepts.
- Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Practice clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

To run the code, you need:

- **Java JDK** (version 8 or above)
- A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham6m/Java-practice.git
2. Open the desired folder in your IDE.

3. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
    javac FileName.java
    java FileName

📌 Notes

Most files are independent and can be run individually.

Comments are added to explain logic wherever needed.

Some solutions may have multiple approaches for learning purposes.
