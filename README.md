# Java Practice

This repository contains my Java practice work, organized into different folders based on topics, concepts, or problem types.  
It serves as a personal learning space to improve Java programming skills and explore various problem-solving techniques.

---

## 📂 Structure

The repository is divided into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific area of Java:

- **Basics/** – Core Java fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and data types.
- **OOPs/** – Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **DSA/** – Data Structures and Algorithms problems (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
- **Java-8/** – Features like Streams, Lambda expressions, and functional programming.
- **Projects/** – Small projects or programs that combine multiple concepts.
- **Misc/** – Any additional practice programs or experiments.

*(Folder names may change or expand as the repository grows.)*
